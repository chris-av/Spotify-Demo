# Spotify Demo
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate a simple use case of the Spotify API. 

Note: I was inspired by a YouTube video from [Jonny Kalambay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prayNyuN3w0&t=1272s). Some of the methods you  see in the project were inspired by his tutorial. 

In addition, the Spotify API is beautifully documented. I made use of the authorization examples [here](https://github.com/spotify/web-api-auth-examples). Spotify also offers some further tools developed by their team for querying data, rather than building the query from the gorund up--I used the JMPerez package which you can find [here](https://github.com/jmperez/spotify-web-api-js).

When in doubt, it is always recommended that you refer to the Spotify for developers pages for troubleshooting errors.
